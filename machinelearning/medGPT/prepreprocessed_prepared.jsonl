{"prompt":"How can medications cause multiple sclerosis (MS) flare-ups?","completion":" Skipping your MS medicine can increase your risk for a flare-up. One study found about 25% of MS patients who stopped taking their medications suffered a relapse. Certain medications for Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis may cause MS-like symptoms. So can drug interactions. Check with your doctor to see if there are medications you're taking that could be interacting with one another."}
{"prompt":"What causes retinitis pigmentosa?","completion":" More than 60 different genes can cause the different types of retinitis pigmentosa. Parents can pass the problem genes on to their children in three different ways: Autosomal recessive RP: Each parent has one problem copy and one normal copy of the gene that's responsible, but they don't have any symptoms. A child that inherits two problem copies of the gene (one from each parent) will develop this type of retinitis pigmentosa. Since two copies of the problem gene are needed, each child in the family has a 25% chance of being affected. Autosomal dominant RP: This type of retinitis pigmentosa requires only one copy of the problem gene to develop. A parent with that gene has a 50% chance of passing it to each child. X-linked RP: A mother who carries the problem gene can pass it down to her children. Each one of them has a 50% chance of getting it. Most women who carry the gene won't have any symptoms. But about 1 out of every 5 will have mild symptoms. Most men who get it will have more severe cases. Fathers who have the gene can't pass it to their children."}
{"prompt":"What is a deviated septum?","completion":" !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } A deviated septum is a condition in which the nasal septum -- the bone and cartilage that divide the nasal cavity of the nose in half -- is significantly off center, or crooked, making breathing difficult. Most people have some sort of imbalance in the size of their breathing passages. In fact, estimates indicate that 80% of people, most unknowingly, have some sort of misalignment to their nasal septum. Only the more severe imbalances cause significant breathing problems and require treatment."}
{"prompt":"What are the concerns about using beta-blockers for chronic migraine?","completion":" These include: Atenolol ( Tenormin) Metoprolol ( Lopressor, Toprol XL) Nadolol ( Corgard) Propranolol ( Inderal, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, Inno Pran) Timolol As many as 4 out of 5 of people who take beta-blockers get relief from their migraines. Still, like all drugs, they can cause side effects. These include feeling depressed and having problems during sex. You may not be able to take beta-blockers if you have asthma or diabetes. Your doctor may suggest a different type of preventive medicine if you have certain types of migraines with auras. These medicines were thought to increase stroke risk with this type of migraine, though the proof is very scant."}
{"prompt":"What is a sleep apnea test?","completion":" This may be done in a sleep disorder center or even at home. A polysomnogram -- or sleep study -- is a multiple-component test that electronically transmits and records specific physical activities while you sleep. The recordings are analyzed by a qualified sleep specialist to determine whether or not you have sleep apnea or another type of sleep disorder. If sleep apnea is determined, you may be asked to do further sleep testing in order to determine the best treatment option."}
{"prompt":"What's a healthy waist measurement?","completion":" For your best health, your waist should be less than 40 inches around for men, and less than 35 inches for women. If it's larger than that, you may want to talk with your doctor about what your next steps are, including losing weight."}
{"prompt":"What should you keep in mind when exercising to help with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)?","completion":" Exercise can help you: Stay mobile Control your weight Boost your mood and energy levels Try different types of exercise, including activities to get your heart pumping, like walking or swimming, and moves that strengthen your muscles and stretch your body. When you make an exercise plan, keep in mind: Start slowly, even with 5 to 10 minutes of activity. Avoid getting overheated if you are sensitive to temperature. Ask a physical therapist to help you build an exercise program."}
{"prompt":"What's in allergy eye drops?","completion":" The key ingredient in allergy eye drops is a drug called an antihistamine, which blocks histamines from doing their work and prevents allergy symptoms. Some newer allergy eye drops, called mast-cell stabilizers, work by stopping your body from making histamines in the first place."}
